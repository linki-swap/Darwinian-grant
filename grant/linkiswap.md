## LinkiSwap: Cross-Chain Liquidity and Asset Bridging

### Project Description

LinkiSwap is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focusing on seamless cross-chain asset bridging using Darwinia’s Msgport. By leveraging Msgport, LinkiSwap will enable users to bridge and swap assets between various blockchains, including EVM and non-EVM networks, while ensuring low transaction costs, enhanced security, and liquidity flow. The project’s core innovation lies in using Msgport’s cross-chain messaging capabilities to lock assets on one chain, mint wrapped tokens on Darwinia, and allow for fluid liquidity movements across different networks, benefiting both DeFi users and liquidity providers.
